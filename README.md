# Numerical Methods Project

This project contains implementations and visualizations of different root-finding methods using Mathematica.

## Files Included:

- **bisection_method**: Implementation of the Bisection Method.
- **bisection_method_visualization**: Graphical visualization of the Bisection Method.
- **Derivative_and_Graphs**: Analysis of functions and their derivatives with plots.
- **newton_raphson_method**: Implementation of the Newton-Raphson Method.
- **newtons_method_root_finding**: Root finding using Newton’s Method with examples.
- **secant_method_fractional.nb**: Secant Method implementation (fractional version).
- **secant_root_finding**: Root finding using the Secant Method.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to compare numerical methods for finding roots of equations and to visualize their behavior graphically.
